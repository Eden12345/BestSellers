# BestSellers

BestSellers is a data visualization that is designed to illustrate how consolidated video game sales are amongst large publishers and their franchises. It breaks down each of the top 52 best selling video games by its unit sales figure and nests each inside nodes indicating its original developer and publisher.

## Description

I used the D3 data visualization library to make my visualization interactive. This also allows me to easily update this project with new data by simply adding or editing entries in my JSON data file.

All of the sources that I used to aggregate the data are listed on the web page along with the visualization via the link above. Please feel free to contact me if you think there are any errors in my research!
