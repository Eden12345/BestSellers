    <p>This data visualization is designed to illustrate how consolidated video game sales are amongst large publishers and their franchises. It breaks down each of the top 52 best selling video games by its unit sales figure along with its original developer and publisher. It also indicates whether or not each game is part of a franchise.<br><br>The only indendently released video games on the list are Mojang's "Minecraft" (at 144 million units sold) and Bluehole's "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds" (at 24 million units sold). The former is only topped only by Spectrum HolyByte's "Tetris" (at 170 million units sold). For contrast, I also added the independently released video games "Braid" and "SOMA" (both at almost 1/2 million copies sold)[1][2].<br><br>If you add up the units sold for each installment of the best selling franchises from Nintendo, Activision, and Rockstar Games, they are as follows: 233,750,000 (Mario/Mario Kart); 224,990,000 (Call of Duty); 155,000,000 (Grand Theft Auto). Some sources, however, estimate that these series are .. .. .. respectively (see Wikipedia article [3]).

    <p>NOTES ON OMISSIONS FROM THIS LIST</p>

    <p>This visualization focuses only on units sold because of the difficulty in comparing revenue between such differently priced products. Activion's "Guitar Hero" franchise, for example, is notable for generating large amounts of revenue, yet no single installment in the series had enough copies sold to make it onto the list of the 50 best selling video games [4][5].<br><br>While digital downloads are considered in these figures, only paid downloads are counted. This means that some mobile games with high download rates are not included if they only use an in-app purchase payment scheme (ie. "Candy Crush") [6]. There are also games whose paid downloads are difficult to track as they were free to download for multiple periods of time, such as usTwo's "Monument Valley" [7].<br><br>If you know of any errors in my data after checking your information against my sources, please contact me as I would be happy to make corrections!
